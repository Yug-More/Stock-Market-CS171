**Project Title:** S&P 500 Explorer

**Authors:** Yug More, Srihan Cheemangunta

**Description of the Question and Research Topic:**
The main objective of the project is to analyse the S&P500 dataset to understand the trends in the stock price, revenue and growth of the companies. We are trying to understand the correlation between different financial factors to understand how the market moves. Using data analytics and various libraries our aim is to understand market trends and how stock prices fluctuate and what is the expected return from investing in certain companies. Thus using historical pricing and data we are building a predictive model that could forecast the future stock movement and tabulate the overall market performance. 

**Project Outline/Plan (Yug More):**

**Selected dataset for my project:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csbfx/cs22a/main/sp500_companies.csv

**Data Collection Plan:**
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Drop any invalid values or null values and standardize numeric/categorical fields.
2. Create Visualizations: Create visualizations for metrics like market capitalization, revenue and stock price for S&P 500 companies.
3. Modeling: Apply the machine learning techniques learned from the class such as linear regressions, clustering and other types of techniques to understand and analyze the patterns across
the companies.
5. Dashboards and Visualizations: Based on the analysis and conclusions derived create plots and dashboards to present the findings and interpret the plots.

**Model Plans:**
After conducting some research on the topic, linear regression model is a feasible option to analyze the annual stock return percentage based on the sector, market capitalization and location of the companies.





**Project Outline/Plan (Srihan Cheemangunta):**

**Selected dataset for my project:** SPX.csv taken from kaggle S&P 500 Historical Data

**Data Collection Plan:**
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Filling in any missing data and changing labels to numbers. 
2. Create Visualizations: Create visualizations with prices during closing time.
3. Modeling: Using either linear regression or Gadient Boosting to make predictions on stock prices for the following week.
5. Dashboards and Visualizations: Based on the model analysis, analyze the model predictions and compare it with the Nasdaq 100 Historical Price Data.

**Model Plans:**
Depending which model between linear regression and gradient boosting works better when analyzing 500 companies, I plan to use that model to predict the next week stock market and compare that with the nasdaq 100 dataset to see which is better at making those predictions.
  
**Project Timeline:**
Week 1: Complete setting up the repository, and define the tasks to be completed for the project
Week 2: Model development (conduct research on different models that could be applied)
Week 3: Visualization, Model Performance and creating a report on the process and findings.
Week 4: Finalize the report and create the presentation for the project.
