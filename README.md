The main objective of the project is to analyse the S&P500 dataset to understand the trends in the stock price, revenue and growth of the companies. We are trying to understand the correlation between different financial factors to understand how the market moves. Using data analytics and various libraries our aim is to understand market trends and how stock prices fluctuate and what is the expected return from investing in certain companies. Thus using historical pricing and data we are building a predictive model that could forecast the future stock movement and tabulate the overall market performance.
